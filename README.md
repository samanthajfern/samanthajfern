👋 Hi, I’m Samantha.

Perseverance and compassion are at the heart of everything I do. With my multifaceted experience in engineering, technology, and leadership development, I have an intense passion for product management, focusing on what matters--empowering the user’s voice 🗣

🌱 I’m currently...
- ➡️ building my own website using AI tools like v0 & bolt, deploying with Vercel! GitHub @samanthajfern
- ➡️ Finishing my 150th class of Solidcore 👩🏼‍🎓 
- ➡️ Mentoring women in tech 👩‍💻 & advising in INIT, the premier CS honors society @ my alma mater FIU

👀 While not at work I'm either skiing, biking, Zumba dancing, creating glitch art, theme park trekking all year round!

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate & ideate on impactful technical products that enable radical vulnerability, increasing overall mental health.
