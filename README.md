👋 Hi, I’m Samantha.

Perseverance and compassion are at the heart of everything I do. With my multifaceted experience in engineering, technology, and leadership development, I have an intense passion for product management, focusing on what matters--empowering the user’s voice 🗣

🌱 I’m currently...
- ➡️ building my own website using Gatsby.js & deploying with Netlify! GitHub @samanthajfern
- ➡️ Open to work: Associate / Entry-Level Technical Product / Program management roles.
- ➡️ Finishing my B.S. degree in Information Technology, graduating May 2021 👩🏼‍🎓 
- ➡️ Mentoring women in tech 👩‍💻 & advising UPE, the premier CS honors society @ FIU

👀 I’m interested in skiing, biking, Zumba dancing, metal concerts, glitch art, the Fallout series, theme park trekking all year round (pre-coivd), and cats!

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate & ideate on impactful technical products that enable radical vulnerability, increasing overall mental health.
